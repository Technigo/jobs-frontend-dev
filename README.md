# Frontend Developer 
Placement: Stockholm
Format: Full-time 

**Technigo is a new form of education, a fast paced tech education formed to teach front-end developers in the latest technologies. We’re proud to have an extremely high percentage of female participants in our full-time programming educations – a number that is unheard of from other programming educations. Our initiatives and organisations are often featured in media and TV and our founders have been featured as a few of the most powerful women in technology by ELLE Magazine and Expressen.** 

**We are driven by a true passion for technology. For us, technology is creative, and a tool which enables you to reach and affect many people globally. A tool we would like to provide to more people.**

We’re currently looking for someone with tech skills who can help us and our students to move forward in the early stages of their education for both our Technigo organisation but also our sister organisation Tjejer Kodar. The role is based in Stockholm, where you’ll work in a smaller team to ensure that our students get the help they need and you’ll be a key player in pushing us forward technically. 

### A few of this things you’ll do in the role: 

* **Help others.** By giving support in our online forum, do live code alongs on webinars and do code reviews for our students. 
* **Share with others.** You’ll be expected to do research and keep up with the news of the tech community to share this with our students and drive a conversation and discussion in our Slack channels. 
**Learn more.** You’ll always be challenged to learn more within code and tech – that’s what we do for a living and we live like we learn. You’ll also be a key player in making and updating course material to be up to date and helping project manage the creation of new material and educations. 

This role is very much in the border of tech and people – and you need to have skills for both. We’re looking for someone who is passionate about tech and likes to share knowledge with others. You need to enjoy working in a smaller team and in a startup environment. 

### Requirements: 
* Professional background in programming and fluent in HTML, CSS and Javascript (ES6). 
* Fluent in English (a big plus for Swedish also). 
* Have a passion for tech. 
* Feel comfortable speaking for an audience. 
* You enjoy helping others. 

### Bonus points if you: 
* Also know React. 
* Knowledge about Node.js
* Have a background from a boot camp education. 

## What we offer you

* Fun team and creative environment. 
* A way to actually work with getting more people into tech – also, mainly women. 
* Central office on Södermalm in Stockholm. 
* Good benefits such as vacation and pension. 
* A work environment where learning new things (on work hours) is encouraged. 
* Flexible work hours.
